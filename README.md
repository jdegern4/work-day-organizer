# Work Day Scheduler

https://jdegern4.github.io/work-day-organizer/

## Description
The Workday Organizer allows you to view all of your daily events at a glance. Using jQuery, the Organizer immediately draws your eyes to the current hour and differentiates between past and future events via contrasting colors. To edit hourly events, simply click on the text, make changes, and click on the respective Save button. Even if you don't make any changes for hours (or even days), the Organizer will still highlight the current hour of the workday.
